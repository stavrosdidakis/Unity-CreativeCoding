### ðŸŒ€ `LinesOscillation`
<img src="README/1.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Generates flowing, oscillating lines using Catmull-Rom splines. Each line has animated waveforms with Perlin noise and Z-axis motion, creating a lively, vibrating mesh effect.

### ðŸŽ¨ `OffsetLines`
<img src="README/2.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Draws multiple offset lines with dynamic movement along Bezier curves. Randomized amplitudes and frequencies create a layered, vibrating structure. Uses gradient coloring for added depth.

### ðŸŒŒ `SpiralLines`
<img src="README/3.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Builds elegant, spiraling line structures that twist and animate in real-time. Each line has a randomized phase offset, resulting in a dynamic, swirling motion.

### ðŸŒ± `PerlinLines`
<img src="README/4.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Lines that grow and twist over time, driven by Perlin noise. Lines expand and contract organically, creating a constantly shifting, evolving pattern.

### ðŸŒ€ `MorphedCircles`
<img src="README/5.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Creates circles that continuously morph their shape using Perlin noise, generating organic, pulsating forms. Each circle uses a different material or shader for visual diversity.

### ðŸ§¶ `TangledCircles`
<img src="README/6.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="50%" />

Generates hundreds of tangled circles in 3D space, driven by Perlin noise. Each line has a random color, producing a dense, chaotic, and beautiful mesh of motion.
